## Assignment 2:

### With one real world example for each of (a) parallel computing, (b) distributed systems and (c) autonomic computing, state your opinion on how the cloud computing help achieve these three technologies.

### Autonomic Computing:
<p style="text-align: justify;">Autonomic computing refers to the self-managing capabilities of distributed computer resources through adaptive technologies which helps to overcome the rapidly growing complexity of computing systems. These decisions are based upon high level of policies, plans, logic and feedback from constantly monitored system status.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Autonomic computing initiative (ACI), developed by IBM, was designed to mimic the autonomic nervous system of the human body. ACI demonstrates and advocates networked computer systems that do not involve a lot of human intervention other than defining input rules.</p>  

Some of the characteristics of AS defined by IBM are:
1. Self-configuration, Self-healing, Self-optimization, Self-protection.
1. Later expanded characteristics: Self-regulation, learning, awareness, organization, creation, management and description.

AC has helped cloud computing through following means:
1. AC and Cloud computing are some of the building blocks of pervasive computing (ubiquitous computing), a future of computing model where ever computing unit is interconnected creating the internet of everything (IoE).  Cloud computing platform such as Microsoft Azure IoT suite, Google Cloud’s IoT platform, IBM Watson IoT Platform, etc. are some of the major infrastructural backbone of IoE and in such complex and vast network AC plays an essential role for self-intelligence of the entire system.
1. Reduces Total cost of ownership (TCO) due to self-maintaining capabilities resulting less frequent breakdowns.
1. Reduces deployment and maintenance cost, time and increases stability of the system eg: CI/CD.
1. Adopts and implements directives based on changing environment and policies.
1. Provides server consolidation for max. system availability and minimizes cost and effort on management of server farms.

### Distributed Computing:
<p style="text-align: justify;">A Distributed system is collection of multiple autonomous computers that communicate through a computer network. A single task is divided among the computers in the network, they interact with each other and overall task is completed faster than using a single computer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cloud computing is often considered as merely a new application for classic distributed systems, where a large pool of systems is connected in private or public networks, to provide dynamically scalable infrastructure for application, data and file storage as a service. The difference that cloud computing brings compared to traditional concepts of “distributed computing” is to broaden horizons across organizational boundaries. It has brought a practical approach to experience direct cost benefits and it has the potential to transform a data center from a capital-intensive setup to a variable priced environment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, we can conclude that cloud computing has broaden the scope of distribution system. Cloud computing has made distributed system more available, directly and indirectly, and has made it more important than ever before.  Cloud computing is an evolution of distributed system itself.</p>

### Parallel computing:  
<p>Parallel computing is the model of computing where a task is decomposed into smaller set of instructions that can be executed simultaneously on the computer resource.</p>

The computer resource here typically means:
1. A single computer with multiple processors/cores.  
1. An arbitrary number of such computers connected by a network.

<p style="text-align: justify;">Parallel computing helps to achieve speedups in computation, efficient use of full hardware potential, scalability of computer resources, robustness and help in solving massively parallel real-world problem.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In past decade parallel computing has gain massive improvement in its development with the introduction of accelerators in various forms like GPUs, and technologies like cloud computing, web technology converging, big data and so on. Taking the case of cloud computing alone, cloud computing has created a massive potential and accessibility of parallel computing to global user. Cloud computing has increased connectivity to computer resources, new methods of improving and approaching parallelization and so on. Cloud computing services like Amazon EC2, Go Grid, etc. open source cloud infrastructure software like Nimbus, Eucalyptus, etc. and frameworks like Hadoop, MapReduce, etc. has make the possibility of dynamically provisioning of compute resources less time and resource intensive, availability of resources more affordable, and so on.</p>

### Conclusion:

<p style="text-align: justify;">Not only cloud computing, but most technologies works in a mutual relationship with each other. Development of one technology helps to uplift the development of other technology. So, cloud computing has given a widely accessible paltform for these technologies with an affordable price structure, flexiable and customizable environment and many more. On the other hand, these technologies are also responsible for such versatile characteristics of cloud computing like: scalability, reliablity, flexibility, performance, pricing etc. Its such relationship, among different domains of technology, that makes the technological achievements possible.</p>
