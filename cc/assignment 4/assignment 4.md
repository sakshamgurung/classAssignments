inhibitors of cloud adoption and determining the viability of a cloud service**

|                        |   | **Cloud adoption inhibitors**                                                                                                           | **None** |   | **Cloud adoption drivers**                                                                               |
|------------------------|---|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|---|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Scalability**        |   | Load will remain constant over time                                                                                                     |          | 1 | Load will vary significantly                                                                             |
| **Elasticity**         | 1 | Project load will vary at a low pace                                                                                                    |          |   | Project load will vary at a fast pace.                                                                   |
| **Adaptability**       |   | Once deployed, the solution is not modified                                                                                             |          | 1 | There will be multiple changes on solution over time, and deployments can benefit from cloud automation. |
| **Financial strategy** |   | We have the financial capital to host the solution in our own data center.                                                              | 1        |   | Our organization aims at shifting capital expenditures to operational expenditure.                       |
| **Skills**             |   | We have internal capabilities to operate this solution                                                                                  |          | 1 | We do not have internal capabilities (such as skills, infrastructure, space) to operate this solution.   |
| **Security**           | 1 | The solution candidate processes and requires storage of sensitive data                                                                 |          |   | The solution does not process any sensitive data.                                                        |
| **Integration effort** | 1 | The solution candidate must connect to several other applications (e.g. active directory and so forth).                                 |          |   | The solution does not require connection to existing systems.                                            |
| **Exit strategy**      |   | This solution candidate leads to a high level of dependency on cloud service, and it is difficult to switch cloud service if necessary. |          | 1 | It is easier to switch to a different cloud service if necessary.                                        |
| **Urgency**            |   | Request is not urgent                                                                                                                   | 1        |   | Request must be completed very quickly.                                                                  |
| **Project duration**   |   | The solution candidate will be used for a long time.                                                                                    | 1        |   | The solution will be used for a short time.                                                              |

**Conclusion**: A cloud provider with hybrid approach of both traditional and
cloud should be taken.
