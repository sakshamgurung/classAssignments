Q1. **Cloud is not just about simply moving existing application to the cloud
(say, Lift & Shift), such move requires properly architecture resources with a
guaranteed need of failover. Some even say Cloud is a new business model and not
a technology model. What side of this statement are you and why? Justify your
logic.**

Cloud is a new business model with some hint of new technology that had made IT
infrastructure, that would otherwise be accessible only to the bigger
organization, government, universities, and researchers only, accessible to
every individual as a service.

-   The hints of new technology, above, can be justified by the introduction of
    accelerators like:

-   Ever-increasing speed, performance, and efficiency of CPU, GPU, and storage

-   Introduction of new programming paradigms, the evolution of parallel
    programming.

-   The boom of the world wide web, personnel computer and smartphones,
    improvement in internet service and bandwidth with accessibility at
    affordable prices have also played a great role in the usability of the
    cloud.

Cloud computing is often considered as a new application for classic distributed
systems, where a large pool of systems is connected in private or public
networks, to provide dynamically scalable IT infrastructure, platforms and
applications as services.

Cloud can be considered as a service delivery model. It has brought a practical
approach to experience direct cost benefits and it has the potential to
transform a data center from a capital-intensive set up to a variable priced
environment. Its on-demand, “pay as you go” model that reduces the time, money
and people it takes to build and deploy infrastructure and applications. For
example, there has never been the way before Amazon Web Services of being able
to purchase servers for a single hour for less than some hundred dollars.

Thus, due to its relationship with other technologies and ever events that has
made cloud possible, the cloud is a new business model with some new
technologies.
